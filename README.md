I'm a former EMEA Team Lead, previously completing contract work for Google, who has moved over to the dark side and is learning to code at Makers Academy. I've led multiple projects across Europe during my time at Google with the proprietary purpose of collecting multiple data types to help improve location data, but now I want to use my skills to dive into a new aspect of technology which I believe I have an exciting career in.

I'm currently a Junior Software Developer at Capgemini, focusing primarily on Ruby & Ruby on Rails at Makers Academy, but have already enrolled on a Java bootcamp which will begin mid April.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career it has been essential that I maintain excellent communication skills, as a translator between the technical and non-technical if you will; whether as a Team Lead acting as the link between my team in Europe and HQ in London, a Bar Manager hosting training sessions and communicating with customer conflicts, or a Junior Software Developer writing code to solve real world problems.

#### Attention to Detail

My 2 years working for Google have provided me with brilliant preparation for life as a developer. I pick up new concepts with ease and focus on asking important questions to further my knowledge and understanding. Whilst using Agile methodology I am able to spot small mistakes and implement the changes needed to correct them. These skills have served me well in multiple industries and are easily transferable into any new role I may face.

#### Delivery

I have led several technology projects, and am highly experienced in prioritising work, identifying the best approach to reach minimum viable product and iterative delivery.

During the development of the multiplayer game Quizzbuzz for our final project at Makers Academy the team frequently commented on how my guidance kept them focused on MVP. This focus meant we delivered MVP in just two days of development, and achieved version 4 two days later which included all features we had planned for our final presentation.


#### Additional Skills

- Agile
- Ruby
